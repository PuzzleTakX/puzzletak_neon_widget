## Installation â˜º

To use the NavigationView package, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`
file:


```yaml
dependencies: 
puzzletak_neon_widget : ^1.0.0
```
Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Usage

Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:puzzletak_neon_widget /puzzletak_neon_widget .dart';
```

Create a `PTTextNeon` widget and provide the necessary parameters:

```dart
     Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    children: [
            PTTextNeon(text: 'F l u t t e r ',color: Colors.lightBlue,
            font: "five",shine: true,fontSize: 40,
            strokeWidthTextHigh: 3,blurRadius: 25,
            strokeWidthTextLow: 1,backgroundColor: Colors.black,),
            
            PTTextNeon(text: ' & ',color: Colors.deepPurple,
            font: "five",shine: true,fontSize: 25,
            strokeWidthTextHigh: 3,blurRadius: 25,
            strokeWidthTextLow: 1,backgroundColor: Colors.black,),
            
            PTTextNeon(text: ' D a r t',color: Colors.teal,
            shine: true,fontSize: 40,
            font: "five",strokeWidthTextHigh: 3,blurRadius: 20,
            strokeWidthTextLow: 1,backgroundColor: Colors.black,),
        ],
    )
```

This code seems to be an example of using the PTTextNeon widget in Flutter. Here's an explanation of its properties:

    text: The text you want to display with neon animation (in this case, "F l u t t e r ").
    color: The color of the neon glow (light blue in this case).
    font: The font style to use ("five" in this case, which is likely a custom font).
    shine: A boolean flag indicating whether the neon effect should shine (true in this case).
    fontSize: The font size (40 in this case).
    strokeWidthTextHigh: The width of the neon glow for the text when it's highly illuminated (3 in this case).
    blurRadius: The amount of blur applied to the neon glow (25 in this case).
    strokeWidthTextLow: The width of the neon glow for the text when it's less illuminated (1 in this case).
    backgroundColor: The background color behind the neon text (black in this case).

This code appears to be creating a neon text effect in a Flutter app using the PTTextNeon widget with customizable properties.
